# 📝 About the Project

The year 2019 was dominated by the emergence of COVID-19, leading to one of the most impactful pandemics since the Spanish flu in the 20th century. Social isolation became pivotal globally to curb the virus's spread, causing severe economic disruptions. Many businesses faced bankruptcy or closure due to unprepared logistical operations amidst the new era of social distancing. Searches for deliveries surged exponentially on Google® and Twitter®, becoming some of the most sought-after topics worldwide.

In response to this scenario, this article analyzed and developed a SaaS (Software as a Service) business model, creating a comprehensive application consisting of a web platform and a mobile application, both communicating via API. The aim was to facilitate connections between companies and the delivery of their products to end customers. JavaScript, via the Node.js platform, and abstractions like React were utilized for UI development. The architecture demonstrated enhanced fluidity in communication between managers and couriers, functioning as a facilitator for parcel deliveries.
